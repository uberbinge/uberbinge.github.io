One fine afternoon and I hear the slack sound of a new message. Someone was unable to install one of the latest APKs from our #stable-build channel. To get more context I asked if they are trying to install the first time to understand the potential error surface. I asked the question, "Did the previous versions use to work for you?" and the reply was yes and they sent me a link to the previous working version, which was very helpful. Thanks!

## Check the intensity of üî•

Naturally, I tried to reproduce the issue by installing the APK on my device, while fully hoping it works.... "**it didn't !**" (mild panic, as we released the same build recently, time to head to Playstore to check if we mega screwed up). Surprise, I can't check from Playstore right away as I am not added as internal tester there and this APK isn't publicly available. After some exploring in the PlayStore console, I did add myself one of the internal track testers but it looks like I still can't download the app as something to do with MDM and what not. I asked one of my peers (who was thrifty enough to take one the test device with him, #CoronaTimes) to try to install via that device and meanwhile, I tried to look for analytics numbers to see how many people are using our new version of the APK and were they able to install it at all. Amid all this drama we noticed the APK size also jumped by 100MB. Aha could be one of the clues whatever is responsible for this outrageous feat, might be responsible for why our APK isn't installable anymore. Thankfully, things via Playstore were all fine, APK size was almost the same as before and it was installable.

## Following the breadcrumbs

Having a brief look at the latest commits we did update our MAP(S) SDKs. I suspected they did something in their new versions, so we created two PRs to revert those updates. And wait for Bitrise to build again (which takes like 30 minutes to build and sometimes fails randomly as well), after the revert, VOILA!
No sorry, it didn't work, and the APK size is still double than before. Hmm... Time to do some more detective work.
 
I started building the APK locally through this because waiting on Bitrise for half an hour for each commit wasn't that attractive. APK built from Gradle or AS was working. We did test the QA APK before releasing, and the QA APK was built locally because that time Bitrise was again throwing some random errors to us. (I noted that we need to make our CI/CD pipeline more stable to avoid this kind of issues in future).

Now let‚Äôs continue from the reverse order this time, let‚Äôs find which commit is responsible for the issue. After going through multiple commits I found out that *one* commit which was causing the APK size to bump, it had some android libraries updates like constraint-layout and material-design but also Android-Gradle-Plugin version to [3.6.1](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#3-6-0).

 The only pointer I was following while building locally was to see where the increase in size happens, and it was that innocent commit with two android libraries and Gradle-Plugin update. Ok now YES! we have the commit let's check which of the updates are causing the size to spike, I thought must be the libs update to newer versions so let's check the Gradle-Plugin update first and be done with it that this not the problem, but surprise! After the only plugin update, it increases our APK size, hmm, that's not expected. Well ok, let's check release notes of the changes, [lo and behold!](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#extractNativeLibs)

> Native libraries packaged uncompressed by default
When you build your app, the plugin now sets extractNativeLibs to "false" by default. That is, your native libraries are page aligned and packaged uncompressed. While this results in a larger upload size, your users benefit from the following:
Smaller app install size because the platform can access the native libraries directly from the installed APK, without creating a copy of the libraries.
Smaller download size because Play Store compression is typically better when you include uncompressed native libraries in your APK or Android App Bundle.
If you want the Android Gradle plugin to instead package compressed native libraries, include the following in your app's manifest:

    <application
    android:extractNativeLibs="true"... >
    </application>

It was expected behavior to have the APK size increased, but why it isn't installable? To be precise, APK from Bitrise isn't installable but locally everything is fine. Interesting question indeed, let's find out how Bitrise is generating the APK? Why that APK works via Playstore but doesn't when we try to install it on our devices.

Meanwhile, to let internal people install our APK via Bitrise QRcode, I created the PR to set exactly above mentioned setting for Native libraries. With that change, APK size was back to previous size and APK from Bitrise worked. Phew, now we have some breathing room to explore more and concurrently internals can still install and test our APK like they used to.

## Let the rabbit hole begin

So I head over to the Bitrise and check how we build the APK, curiously enough we build and sign twice, one for the Playstore and one for internally downloadable. That might be the reason why it's working via Playstore and not internally. Let's check the difference, ah we upload an App-Bundle to the Playstore and build a normal release-signed APK for our internal usage. Then Playstore optimizes the App-Bundle and the actual download for our users is still almost the same as before, nice! 

Digging deep into how Bitrise is building the APK I see it is nothing out of usual, just calling the same assembleRelease Gradle task which I already checked locally works as well. But Bitrise is also signing the APK and in my local tests, I only worked with debug signing keys and not the actual credentials used by Bitrise. So I downloaded the signing keys and passwords from Bitrise and generated the APK and signed it via Android Studio. And..... it worked fine üôÉ. 

In Android Studio, to sign the APK there are two options. Sign the APK with signature 1 or 2 and both ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I tried all three variants and APK was still installable from all variants.
Unable to reproduce via AS, I thought let's check how the signing is being done on the CI. Turns out for signing, Bitrise provides an Android-Sign Step which is using the approach to run Jarsign on the APK first and then Zipalign it. I tried same steps via command line on my machine and finally, the error was reproduced locally as well.

Ok as next step I set the "extractNativeLibs to true" locally as suggested in the release notes of the android-gradle-plugin and re-ran the same steps and the APK was installable again with 80MB less size than the previous APK. Now more curious than ever I head over to read through docs about how to sign the Android APK, and I saw this there is new APKSign utility also available instead of using JARSign. 

The only change mentioned in the doc is that if you use JARSign you need to Zipalign the APK *afterward* as after the JARSign the 4-byte alignment is broken and you need Zipalign tool to align with 4-bytes again. 

I used these commands to sign the APK and verify the alignment afterward.

1. Sign the APK with jarsigner

    jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore $APP_KEY app-release-unsigned.apk alias -storepass pass
2. Align the APK and page align the shared objects as well. ([source](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/zipalign))

    zipalign -v -p 4 app-release-unsigned.apk aligned.apk 
(-v is for alignment, from the docs "The <alignment> is an integer that defines the byte-alignment boundaries. This must always be 4 (which provides 32-bit alignment) or else it effectively does nothing." ), you can read more about zipalign [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/zipalign).
3. Check the alignment is correct.

    zipalign -c -v -p 4 aligned.apk

`**-c** to check the alignment.`

But in when I ran the check after printing a bunch of (OK - compressed) after file names, in the end, it said: "Verification FAILED". My assumption was with the uncompressed native libraries zipalign is not aligning those files correctly, so it could be a bug in zipalign, but then I remember there is something like apksigner and in the docs, it mentions you should sign the APK with apksigner now and the App-Bundles with Jarsigner.

I tried the steps mentioned in the docs. One thing which was different from previous steps is you are supposed to zipalign the APK first and then sign in with apksigner as the signature of the APK will be invalid if the file contents are changed after the signing (makes sense).

 From the docs of Zipalign:

> **Caution:**¬†You must use zipalign at one of two specific points in the app-building process, depending on which app-signing tool you use:

If you use¬†**[apksigner](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apksigner)**, zipalign must only be performed¬†**before**¬†the APK file has been signed. If you sign your APK using apksigner and make further changes to the APK, its signature is invalidated.

If you use¬†**[jarsigner](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/signing.html)**, zipalign must only be performed¬†**after**¬†the APK file has been signed.

Anyhow, I used the Zipalign *before* signing the APK with apksigner and after zipalign. I checked the alignment with the -c option but it still said verification failed at the end. I proceeded with the apksinger step with high hopes thinking it will work anyhow but it didn't, #sadpanda. 

Now almost out of all options but scratching my head as well how it works fine when we sign the APK from AndroidStudio as it must be doing zipalign as well. To confirm my assumption, I assembledRelease again and this time I ran the zipalign -c check before actually aligning the APK and to my surprise it said "Verification successful"! The APK generated via assembleRelease Gradle task is already correctly aligned or it would seem so. Naturally, I just signed the APK with apksigner and viola! the APK with uncompressed native libraries is installable again.

## Next steps

- Report a bug with google that zipalign is not working when native libraries aren't compressed. I will have to reproduce it in a separate project first but could be difficult as it may need the native libraries we are using in our project which aren't openly available yet.
- Ask google if my assumption is correct the APK generated via the assembleRelease task from Gradle is already correctly aligned? If yes, maybe they can reflect that in the documentation as well. Otherwise, file a different bug because why zipalign verification is successful if the APK isn't correctly aligned already.
- Provide update to the Bitrise AndroidSignApk step and instead of using Jarsign use APK sign there in case of APKs. Maintain the App-Bundle sign as it is, and use apksigner for the APKs without aligning them manually via zipalign and rely on the fact that APKs generated via assembleRelease are already correctly aligned.
