I guess it takes nothing less than Steve Jobs to not to fall in the trap of public demand, the new Apple watch got all the Appliness but it lacks the Steve'ness for a whole new category of products.

It works and looks a lot like its competitors and this time they were late in the party too. Being late wouldn't had matter enough if they would have got it exceptionally right or 'different' this time too (because historically they always does). 

P.S: yes ApplePay is awesome and well implemented.
