    <h2>The Journey</h2>
    <p>
      From my early days of infatuation with Android to a serious commitment in backend development, I've journeyed through the tech world with curiosity and excitement. What started as a passion project evolved into a career of designing robust, scalable systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      My approach blends computer science fundamentals with creativity and genuine collaboration. I thrive on pairing with others on projects, believing that programming is engaging, enjoyable, and ultimately a shared experience. It's not just about finding solutions—it's about the journey we take to get there.
