I'm a computer science graduate who found a lifelong match in software development. From the early days of infatuation with Android to a serious commitment to backend development, I've journeyed through the tech world with curiosity and excitement.

Lately, I've been spending quality time with Kotlin, Android, serverless technologies, TypeScript, and AWS. Together, we make quite the team, designing scalable and robust solutions.

My approach blends computer science fundamentals with creativity and collaboration. I thrive on pairing up on projects, believing that programming is engaging and enjoyable. It's not just about finding solutions but the exciting journey along the way...
